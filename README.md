ls# Saarthi AI — Lead Qualification & Sales Script Generator

A course-ready full-stack prototype for lead scoring and agent script generation targeted at Tier-2/3 Indian markets.

## What's included
- FastAPI backend with two endpoints: `/api/score_lead` and `/api/generate_script`
- React (Vite) frontend with simple lead form and outputs
- Prompt library and dummy leads
- Dockerfiles and Render deployment spec

## Quickstart (local / Codespace)
Follow instructions in `hand over/Handover.md`.

## Defaults
- LLM: OpenAI-compatible (expects OPENAI_API_KEY)
- Host: Render (recommended) but you can use Railway/Vercel/etc.

## Support
If you want, I can:
- Create the GitHub repo and push the files
- Convert `Handover.md` to a PDF
- Add a simple CI workflow
